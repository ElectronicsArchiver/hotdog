# hotdog
A pocket pussy with depth sensing.

This repo contains the schematic, 3D prints and Arduino code required to build a Hotdog.

Thanks to [ManlyMarco](https://github.com/ManlyMarco) for coming up with the idea.

Here is a demo of how it works: https://www.erome.com/a/rvRyi8gS

## Parts
Here are all the parts you'll need for a Hotdog connected via USB. If you have access to a 3D printer and use a cheap Nano clone with CH340, the whole thing will run you around $20, not counting the sleeve itself.
- A transparent sleeve (I used [this one](https://www.thehandy.com/product/open-ended-sleeve-hard/?ref=saucekebenfield&utm_source=saucekebenfield&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=The%20Handy%20Affiliate%20program))
- A 3D print of [this](https://github.com/Sauceke/hotdog/releases/latest/download/hotdog-case-top.stl)
- A 3D print of [this](https://github.com/Sauceke/hotdog/releases/latest/download/hotdog-case-bottom.stl)
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x single row 15 pin female header
- 2x universal PCB, 50mm×100mm (something like [this](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WITTKOWARE-Perforated-Compartments-Copper-RM2-54/dp/B07W8H39TR), [this](https://www.hestore.hu/prod_10031793.html?lang=en) or [this](https://ormix.lv/en/catalog/item/id/21692/))
- 5x GL5528 photoresistor
- 3x 334-15/T1C1-4WYA LEDs (these are actually overkill, you could also go with dimmer LEDs and a smaller resistor)
- 1x 1kΩ resistor
- A long USB cable (for the Nano)
- Mini zip ties (less than 3mm in width)
- Rubber bands
- Solder and hook-up wire, duh

## Schematic
Complete assembly guide soon.
